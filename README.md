## Hello! 👋

I'm Riley, a current graduate student pursuing a MS in Computer Science at CSU Chico who is interested in careers in Machine Learning and/or Software Development.  

I am currently a fellow in Cornell Tech's year long Break Through Tech AI program, where I completed a Foundations of Machine Learning Certificate, a time-series forecasting ML project with partner company Fermata Energy, and am working on an ML project that aims to understand and diagnose ADHD in females.  

Additionally, I am currently co-creating a web-based tool, DJSongMatch, which recommends songs to DJs for potentential mixes and mashups.  

I am excited to continue to learn and expand my skillset!
